#1. Write the maximum and minimum numbers.
#       Could be done with a filter (replace numMax or numMin whenever
#       a larger or smaller number is come across, respectively

#2. Write the kth smallest value.
#       You would need a list for this. Sort the list then index what
#       value you want.

#3. Write the sum of the squares of the numbers.
#       I think this could be done with a filter - as you read in numbers,
#       square them and add them to a running total.

#4. Write the average of the numbers.
#       This could be done with a filter. Have a running total variable,
#       as well as a variable you increment with each added value, and
#       divide them.

#5. Write the percentage of numbers greater than the average.
#       You would need a list. You could find the average with a filter,
#       but then sort a list and index to find where the average would fall,
#       then divide how many remaining elements by length.

#6. Write the numbers in increasing order.
#       Need a list. Sort it and print it.

#7. Write the numbers in random order.
#       You'd need a list for this too. Then just random.shuffle() it.
